# Sign Language Alphabet Recognizer

Using Computer vision and deep learning models to generate a video capture script to interpret the sign gestures to their corresponding alphabets.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Tensorflow, 
, Cv2, 
Keras.

### How to Use the code

Once the prerequisites are met, you can either directly download the model (acc:96%) and run the video capture script or you can follow the instructions to generate your own model.
 
### Generate Your dataset
I have uploaded the dataset generated and processed incase you wish to generate your own run the scripts image capture and process for every alpabet except "j" and "z". This will create your dataset for the model to be trained and tested on.

### Training
To train your model i suggest you to use google colab to utilise the GPU option and train the model over the data set either generated or available.

### Video capture 
Now go ahead and download the trained model and deploy it using the video capture script to interpret sign language characters.
