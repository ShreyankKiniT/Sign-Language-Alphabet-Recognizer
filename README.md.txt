This project is to recognize sign language gestures and interpret them as an alphabet.

For the set up of this project basic requirements are:
Tensorflow
Cv2
Keras

Two ways to use this project are, either to download the pre-trained model (acc:96%) and run the video capture script, or you can generate your own 
data set, then preprocess it and generate your model.
Model generation is suggested to be carried out on Colab to utilize the GPU facility for faster computation.
